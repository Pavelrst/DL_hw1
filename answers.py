part2_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
No. Generalizing does not necessarily increase together with increasing the k value in Knn. Increasing it does increase generalization but uptil a certain limit which varies with the model required to describe and the examples. An extreme example is that setting up k to be the same as the entire train set, probably wouldn't get very good results, since it will allways give the same answer which is the label that is most common in the training set. In the other extreme setting up k to be one would be extreamly sensitive to noisy data and outliers.
